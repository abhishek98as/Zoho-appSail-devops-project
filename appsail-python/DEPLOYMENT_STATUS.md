# Deployment Status Report

## Current Status
The Zoho synchronization feature has been successfully implemented locally but needs to be deployed to Zoho Catalyst AppSail.

## What Has Been Done

### 1. Code Implementation ✅
- **main.py**: Updated with Zoho integration and scheduler
- **zoho_sync_scheduler.py**: New file with automatic sync functionality
- **Database Support**: Added handling for "Updated" column in delivered_logs table

### 2. New Features Added ✅
- Automatic synchronization every 60 minutes
- Concurrent processing (10 records at a time)
- Token auto-refresh (every 55 minutes)
- Status priority handling (delivered > failed > accepted > sent)
- Error handling and retry logic

### 3. New API Endpoints ✅
- `/zoho/sync` - Manual sync trigger
- `/zoho/status` - Check Zoho connection
- `/zoho/scheduler/status` - Get scheduler status
- `/zoho/scheduler/start` - Start scheduler
- `/zoho/scheduler/stop` - Stop scheduler
- `/zoho/test-queue-lookup` - Test queue ID lookup

### 4. Documentation Created ✅
- ZOHO_SYNC_README.md - Quick start guide
- ZOHO_SYNC_DOCUMENTATION.md - Detailed documentation
- DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md - Deployment instructions
- test_zoho_sync.py - Test script

## What Needs to Be Done

### 1. Deploy to Zoho Catalyst ⚠️
The updated code needs to be deployed to your Zoho Catalyst AppSail instance.

**Current deployment appears to be an older version** as the new endpoints return errors.

### 2. Deployment Options

#### Option A: Web Console (Recommended)
1. Login to https://catalyst.zoho.com/
2. Select project: tesst-knight
3. Go to AppSail > Your App
4. Upload these files:
   - `main.py` (replace existing)
   - `zoho_sync_scheduler.py` (new file)
5. Click Deploy

#### Option B: CLI Deployment
```bash
# Requires authentication
catalyst login
catalyst deploy
```

#### Option C: Git Push (if configured)
```bash
git add appsail-python/main.py appsail-python/zoho_sync_scheduler.py
git commit -m "Add Zoho sync scheduler"
git push
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Testing
After deployment, run:
```bash
python test_zoho_sync.py
```

Or manually test:
```bash
# Check scheduler status
curl -X POST https://test-knight-50030314031.development.catalystappsail.in/zoho/scheduler/status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"asingh50@deloitte.com","password":"Abhi@1357#"}'
```

## Key Files for Deployment

```
/workspace/appsail-python/
├── main.py                    # MUST DEPLOY (Updated)
├── zoho_sync_scheduler.py     # MUST DEPLOY (New)
├── requirements.txt           # Already deployed (No changes)
├── test_zoho_sync.py         # Optional (For testing)
└── *.md files                # Optional (Documentation)
```

## Expected Behavior After Deployment

1. **Scheduler Auto-Start**: Begins immediately when app starts
2. **First Sync**: Runs immediately after startup
3. **Recurring Sync**: Every 60 minutes automatically
4. **Token Management**: Auto-refresh every 55 minutes
5. **Error Resilience**: Failed updates don't stop the process

## Important Notes

1. **Database Requirement**: The "Updated" column must exist in delivered_logs table
2. **No Manual Intervention**: Once deployed, runs automatically
3. **Monitoring**: Use `/zoho/scheduler/status` to check progress
4. **Logs**: Check Catalyst logs for sync activity

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the code** using one of the methods above
2. **Verify deployment** using the test script
3. **Monitor first sync** in the logs
4. **Check Zoho records** are being updated

The implementation is complete and tested locally. It just needs to be deployed to your Zoho Catalyst environment to start working.
